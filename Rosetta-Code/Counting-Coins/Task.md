There are four types of common coins in   US   currency:
	quarters   (25 cents)
	dimes   (10 cents)
	nickels   (5 cents),   and
	pennies   (1 cent) 


There are six ways to make change for 15 cents:
	A dime and a nickel
	A dime and 5 pennies
	3 nickels
	2 nickels and 5 pennies
	A nickel and 10 pennies
	15 pennies


Task
How many ways are there to make change for a dollar using these common coins? (1 dollar = 100 cents).

Optional
Less common are dollar coins (100 cents);   and very rare are half dollars (50 cents).   With the addition of these two coins, how many ways are there to make change for $1000?

(Note:   the answer is larger than   232).
